### Signal path diagram for the Behringer UMC-404HD audio interface in .dia and .pdf format.

"This is a **conceptual schematic** of the signal path for the behringer U-PHORIA UMC404HD Audiophile 4x4, 24-Bit/192 kHz USB Audio/MIDI Interface with MIDAS Mic Preamplifers.  A _sweet, sweet_ piece of equipment.

Included is the diagram **source in .dia** format.  [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia "Dia Wiki") is a program for drawing structured diagrams (C) 1998-2009 The Free Software Foundation, part of the Gnome Project.

Also there is a **rendered .pdf** file of the schematic for your viewing pleasure if you don't have access to Dia.

The source and render are both placed in the **Public Domain** by me in the hopes that it will be illuminating to somebody.

If I've really gotten something **wrong** in this schematic, create an **Issue** or **Pull Request** and I'll update it...

I mainly added a representation of Inserts routing and distinguished XLR vs TRS inputs routing/controls.
And rotated the Monitor switch so that everyone clearly sees USB Playback 3-4 won't internally route to Main Out.
